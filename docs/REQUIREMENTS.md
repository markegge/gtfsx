# GTFS·X — Requirements

## Overview

GTFS·X is a web application for creating, editing, analysing, and publishing GTFS (and GTFS-Flex) transit feeds. It targets small-to-mid-sized transit agencies and the consultants who serve them. The primary surface is a Mapbox-backed editor where alignments are drawn before stops are placed; analysis features let users size service against demand, demographics, and cost; and a backend tier handles accounts, multi-agency workspaces, publication, and embeddable rider-facing widgets.

### Status snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Editor (anonymous, IndexedDB-only)** | Live in production at https://www.gtfsx.com. Two-rail layout (responsive left nav + configuration right rail). |
| **Backend (auth, projects, orgs, publication, embeds, billing, forum)** | **Live in production since 2026-05-15** with live-mode Stripe billing — `BACKEND_ENABLED=true`, `BILLING_ENABLED=true`. (Originally disabled 2026-05-08 after a premature launch; re-enabled 2026-05-15.) Staging is parked — manual rehearsal only. |
| **Plans** | Free / Pro / Agency / Enterprise, self-serve via Stripe Checkout. See [§3.7](#37-billing-and-subscription-plans). |
| **Source of truth** | `main` — every push auto-deploys to production via Cloudflare Workers Builds. |

If you are picking this project up cold: read this overview, then [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §5 for the live operational picture, then the section below that matches the area you're working in.

---

## How this document is organized

Five sections corresponding to the major capability areas:

1. **GTFS feed editing** — the map + form + timetable workflows that produce a valid GTFS feed.
2. **Analysis and route development** — the things you do *with* a feed before you publish it: demand dots, demographic coverage, Title VI equity, stop-level diagnostics (spacing, balancing, service intensity, accessibility), cost estimation.
3. **Account, organization & billing** — auth, orgs, multi-tenant workspaces, branding, subscription plans, admin console.
4. **Feed publication and distribution** — snapshots, canonical publish, draft links, catalog submissions, and rider-facing embeds + mini-site.
5. **Community forum** — the public Q&A / discussion forum.

Within each section, capabilities are marked:

- ✅ **Shipped** — built and exercised in production.
- 🟡 **Partial** — modelled, with known gaps tracked elsewhere.
- 🔲 **Planned** — specced but not built (tracked in GitHub issues).
- 🚫 **Deferred** — considered and deliberately skipped.

Detailed architecture, data model, API surface, and runbooks live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md); the backlog of 🔲 planned features lives in GitHub issues. This file is intentionally short — it's the orientation map, not the territory.

## 1. GTFS feed editing

### 1.1 GTFS spec coverage

Required and core-optional files are first-class entities in the editor:

| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `agency.txt` | ✅ |
| `stops.txt` | ✅ |
| `routes.txt` | ✅ |
| `trips.txt` | ✅ |
| `stop_times.txt` | ✅ |
| `calendar.txt` | ✅ |
| `calendar_dates.txt` | ✅ |
| `shapes.txt` | ✅ |
| `feed_info.txt` | ✅ |
| `fare_attributes.txt` / `fare_rules.txt` (GTFS-Fares v1) | ✅ |
| GTFS-Fares v2 (`areas.txt`, `stop_areas.txt`, `networks.txt`, `route_networks.txt`, `timeframes.txt`, `rider_categories.txt`, `fare_media.txt`, `fare_products.txt`, `fare_leg_rules.txt`, `fare_transfer_rules.txt`) | 🟡 — Phase 1 round-trip only; see [§1.6](#16-fares) |
| `directions.txt` (auto-emitted from per-route direction names) | ✅ |
| `frequencies.txt` (headway-based service) | 🔲 |
| `transfers.txt` | ✅ |
| `pathways.txt` | 🔲 |
| GTFS-Flex (`locations.geojson`, `booking_rules.txt`, `location_groups.txt`, extended `stop_times`) | ✅ — see [§1.7](#17-gtfs-flex-demand-responsive-service) |

### 1.2 Routes and shapes

The editor enforces a **route-first** workflow: alignment is drawn before stops are placed. This supports rapid iteration on alignments — important for analysis features that compare candidate alignments against demand and demographics.

- ✅ Route metadata (short/long name, color picker, GTFS route type, agency, URL).
- ✅ Polyline drawing with vertex add/remove/drag.
- ✅ Snap-to-road via the Mapbox Map Matching API.
- ✅ Freehand drawing for off-road segments.
- ✅ Multiple shape variants per route (e.g., inbound vs outbound; loops).
- ✅ `shape_dist_traveled` auto-calculated on export.
- ✅ Per-route hidden/visible toggle on the map.
- ✅ Route delete cascades trips, `stop_times`, `route_stops`, fare rules, and shapes only used by this route. Stops unique to the route are deleted by default; user can opt out via the delete confirmation dialog to preserve them as standalone stops in `stops.txt` (useful when reassigning to a different route).

### 1.3 Stops

Stops are placed in the context of the currently-selected route. Default behaviour mimics curbside placement: the stop snaps to the route line and renders offset to the right-hand side relative to direction of travel.

- ✅ Click-to-place along the active route; snaps to nearest point on the route line.
- ✅ Right-hand offset rendering (curbside convention) per direction.
- ✅ Freehand stop placement for off-route stops (park-and-rides, transfer points).
- ✅ Drag to reposition; snapped stops re-snap, freehand stops move freely.
- ✅ Stop attributes: name, code, description, lat/lon, wheelchair boarding.
- ✅ Multi-route stops — stops can be assigned to additional routes; near-duplicate detection prompts to reuse existing stops.
- ✅ Reorder stops along a route via drag-and-drop.
- ✅ Bulk import stops from CSV.
- 🟡 Parent station / location_type hierarchy — types accepted on import + preserved on export, no rich UI for editing the hierarchy.
- ✅ Stop names labelled on the map at appropriate zoom levels.

### 1.4 Calendars and service patterns

- ✅ Day-of-week toggles + start/end date.
- ✅ `calendar_dates` exception editor (added/removed days).
- ✅ Bulk-add common US holidays (MLK Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.) within the active service date range.
- ✅ Visual calendar showing which services run on which dates, with exception days colour-coded.
- ✅ Human-readable service summary ("Weekdays", "Saturday Only", custom day patterns) — surfaced both inside the editor and on rider-facing embeds.
- 🔲 Validation nudge when a service pattern has no exception dates configured for major holidays.

### 1.5 Trips and timetables

- ✅ Per-route timetable grid (rows = trips, columns = stops, cells = times).
- ✅ Trip metadata: headsign, direction, service pattern, block_id, wheelchair_accessible.
- ✅ Auto-interpolate intermediate stop times from distance + speed.
- ✅ Duplicate a trip with a configurable time offset (e.g. "repeat every 30 min").
- ✅ Bidirectional editing — changes in the timetable reflect on the map and vice versa.
- ✅ Service summary showing weekly revenue hours, trips per week, peak vehicles per route.
- ✅ Per-stop departures view ("departures from this stop today").
- 🔲 Frequency-based service entry (`frequencies.txt`).
- 🔲 Marey diagram (time–distance trip chart).
- 🔲 Block assignment UI (block_id is preserved on round-trip but isn't a first-class editor concept yet).

### 1.6 Fares

Fare information is **strongly encouraged**. Empty-fare feeds are flagged prominently; export emits a warning.

#### 1.6.1 GTFS-Fares v1 — shipped

- ✅ Fare attributes (price, currency, payment method, transfer policy, transfer duration).
- ✅ Fare rules — flat-route fares, zone-to-zone matrices.
- ✅ Multiple fare types (regular, reduced, etc., via additional `fare_id`s).
- ✅ Empty-fare warning banner + export-time validation warning.
- 🟡 Zone editor — basic zone assignment per stop is supported; no map-drawing zone editor yet.

#### 1.6.2 GTFS-Fares v2 — Phase 1 shipped, Phases 2/3 planned

GTFS-Fares v2 is a parallel set of files alongside v1; consumers prefer v2 when present. Most agencies serving Google/Apple/MobilityData ingestors today publish both during a transition window. The editor's v2 work is staged:

**Phase 1 — round-trip preservation (shipped).** A v2-aware feed imported into the editor is preserved on export. Round-trip integration test (`run-tests.ts` Phase 12) asserts every v2 file survives import → export → re-import without data loss.

- ✅ Types for all 10 v2 entities in `src/types/gtfs.ts`.
- ✅ Store slice `src/store/fareV2Slice.ts` holding parsed rows.
- ✅ Import (`gtfsImport.ts`) parses `areas.txt`, `stop_areas.txt`, `networks.txt`, `route_networks.txt`, `timeframes.txt`, `rider_categories.txt`, `fare_media.txt`, `fare_products.txt`, `fare_leg_rules.txt`, `fare_transfer_rules.txt`.
- ✅ Export (`gtfsExport.ts`) emits each file when populated; v1 and v2 coexist in the same ZIP.
- ✅ Persistence layer (`persistence.ts`, `serverPersistence.ts`) snapshots the v2 state alongside the rest of the editor.

**Phase 2 — editor UI (planned).** Authoring requires new panels because the v2 cross-references go several levels deep. Recommended build order, each piece blocked on the prior:

- 🔲 Areas editor — name an area, assign stops on the map (replaces v1 zone assignment for v2-only feeds).
- 🔲 Networks editor — group routes for fare purposes.
- 🔲 Rider Categories editor — first-class records for adult / senior / student / child.
- 🔲 Fare Media editor — cash vs smart card vs cEMV vs mobile app.
- 🔲 Fare Products editor — the actual purchasable thing, joining categories and media to prices.
- 🔲 Timeframes editor — peak/off-peak windows tied to service_ids.
- 🔲 Leg Rules editor — which (area + network + timeframe + rider category) combo costs which fare product.
- 🔲 Transfer Rules editor — free / discounted / time-bounded transfer pricing. Distinct from `transfers.txt` (routing semantics) — these are fare rules. Lives under the Fares panel when built.

**Phase 3 — validation (planned).** v2's referential integrity is dense and bad references silently break trip-planner fare display.

- 🔲 Cross-reference checks: `fare_leg_rules.fare_product_id` exists in `fare_products`; `fare_leg_rules.network_id` exists in `networks`; same for `area_id`, `timeframe_group_id`, etc.
- 🔲 Validation that every route is covered by at least one applicable leg rule (or surface a "no fare defined for route X" warning analogous to the v1 check).
- 🔲 Detect v1/v2 conflicts when both are present (e.g. a route priced differently in v1 and v2).

Why staged: the editor's target audience is small and mid-size agencies whose immediate need is the ability to import a v2 feed (often handed to them by a state DOT or a consultant) and round-trip it without data loss. The editor UI is the long pole and adds little value until an agency is actually authoring v2 from scratch — which most aren't yet. Phases 2/3 land as the install base of v2-authoring agencies grows.

### 1.7 GTFS-Flex (demand-responsive service)

Full GTFS-Flex authoring is shipped (`src/store/flexSlice.ts`, `gtfsImport.ts` / `gtfsExport.ts`, `src/components/flex/`):

- ✅ `locations.geojson` polygon zones (single + multi-polygon) with edit handles on the map.
- ✅ `booking_rules.txt` (booking type, prior-notice durations, contact info, messages) per zone or trip.
- ✅ Extended `stop_times` (location_id, pickup/drop_off booking rule ids, pickup/drop-off windows).
- ✅ `location_groups.txt` + `location_group_stops.txt` (a zone is polygon **or** group; mixed not yet supported).
- ✅ `continuous_pickup` / `continuous_drop_off` (route-level + per-`stop_time` fields).
- ✅ Additional service windows per zone (e.g. morning + evening shuttles); travel-time duration factors (mean/safe).
- ✅ `calendar_dates` exception handling; flex route-type customization (715, 1551, 1564).
- ✅ Zone ↔ route ↔ service_id linkage preserved on round-trip; validation + pre-export checks for incomplete zones.
- 🔲 Per-`stop_time` continuous pickup/drop-off overrides surfaced in the timetable UI (route-level covers ~95%); mixed polygon+group zones in a single zone (rare). Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 1.8 Validation, import, export

- ✅ Real-time validator running against canonical GTFS rules — surfaces errors (block export) and warnings (exportable but flagged).
- ✅ Accessibility completeness check — a single aggregate warning when board points are missing `wheelchair_boarding`; cross-links to the per-route breakdown in Stop Analysis (§2.5).
- ✅ Click-to-navigate from a validation message to the offending entity.
- ✅ Auto-fix path in the export dialog for orphan references (trips → missing routes, stop_times → missing stops, etc.).
- ✅ Import GTFS ZIP — parses every supported file, preserves unknown columns where possible, populates the editor.
- ✅ Export GTFS ZIP — emits every populated file. Every stop in editor state is written to `stops.txt`, including unreferenced ones (the validator already warns on unused stops, so users still get the nudge).

---

## 2. Analysis and route development

The editor is also a planning tool. These features answer "where should we run service?" and "what would it cost?" alongside the basic editing flow. They run client-side against in-memory feed state plus bundled or fetched reference data.

### 2.1 Demand dot map

A nationwide vector-tile layer of dot-density transit demand, served from R2 PMTiles via the Cloudflare Worker. Each dot represents one of:

- **High transit propensity** (renters ∪ zero-vehicle households ∪ ages 18–24, deduplicated).
- **Other adults**.
- **Jobs** (LODES WAC, all sectors).

Resolution: TIGER block (TABBLOCK20) geometries, with ACS variables apportioned from block group → block by land area. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) Appendix A for the build pipeline + yearly regen runbook.

- ✅ Built and live: `us-2026b` archive served at `/_demand-tiles/<archive>/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf`.
- ✅ Toggleable map layer (`DemandDotsLayer.tsx`).
- 🚫 Demand dots are **display only** — explicitly not wired into coverage / Title VI analysis. The analysis pipeline uses ACS tract centroids for apportionment to keep methodology stable.

### 2.2 Demographic coverage

Apportioned **buffer coverage** — for the system, each route, or a single stop, how many people / households / workers live within a configurable straight-line buffer (¼ mi default, ½ mi for light rail). ACS block-group totals are apportioned via a circle–circle overlap formula (`coverageAnalysis.ts`), not a binary centroid-in-buffer test. Straight-line buffers approximate walking reach; true street-network walksheds (isochrones) are a planned enhancement, not yet built — the UI labels coverage as "buffer," not "walkshed."

- ✅ Tract centroids bundled per state in `public/census/TR<FIPS>.txt` (CORS-free); block groups inherit their parent tract's centroid.
- ✅ ACS 5-year (2022) variables fetched live from `api.census.gov` (`demographics.ts`): population (B01003), housing units (B25001), workers (B08301), race/ethnicity (B03002), low-income <200% FPL (C17002), zero-vehicle households (B25044), and age 65+/under-18 (B01001). Variables are chosen to be tabulated at **block-group** geography — tract-only tables (B08201 vehicles, B09001 under-18) are deliberately avoided because they return null at block-group level.
- ✅ `CoveragePanel` (system + per-route) with covered population/household/worker totals plus a **demographic profile** table reporting five equity shares (minority, low-income, zero-vehicle, senior, youth) as coverage-vs-county-baseline ratios.
- ✅ Per-stop Coverage tab (`StopCoveragePanel`) — distance to adjacent stops on each route, plus this stop's own buffer demographics and equity shares.
- ✅ Map overlay shading the covered block-group buffers.
- 🔲 Network-distance walksheds (OSM / isochrone service) — deferred; straight-line buffers only for now.

### 2.3 Title VI equity analysis

Implements the FTA Title VI service-equity methodology (Circular 4702.1B): apportions daily trips per stop to nearby block groups, classifies block groups against a regional threshold, and reports the ratio of average daily trips received by each group.

- ✅ End-to-end calculation in `titleVI.ts` reusing `coverageAnalysis`'s overlap math.
- ✅ Minority / non-minority comparison against the regional minority share (FTA Circular 4702.1B).
- ✅ Low-income (Environmental Justice) comparison alongside it — block groups classified against the regional <200% FPL share (C17002), same apportioned-trips methodology.
- ✅ `TitleVIPanel` summarising per-group population, average daily trips, and both ratios (a ratio below ~0.80 flags a potential disparity).

### 2.4 Cost estimation

Estimates annual operating cost from feed structure + per-route inputs.

- ✅ Per-route UI fields for cost-per-revenue-hour and vehicles-required (stored as `_cost_per_revenue_hour` / `_vehicles_required` UI-only fields, ignored on export).
- ✅ Computes weekly revenue hours, peak vehicles, weekly cost — broken out per service pattern and rolled up to annual.
- ✅ `CostSummary` panel surfaces the totals.
- 🔲 Scenario comparison ("what if we add a Saturday run?").
- 🔲 Deadhead-factor inputs beyond a global multiplier.

### 2.5 Stop analysis

A dedicated **Stop Analysis** panel (`StopAnalysisPanel`, gated under the `analysis_basic` plan) with four collapsible, CSV-exportable diagnostics computed client-side from the in-memory feed (`stopAnalysis.ts`). All thresholds are UI-configurable. Inter-stop distance is great-circle (Haversine) in feet — `shape_dist_traveled` is intentionally not used, because GTFS leaves its unit undefined and it can't be trusted across arbitrary feeds.

- ✅ **Stop spacing distribution** — system histogram + per-route medians of consecutive-stop spacing on each route's dominant trip pattern (longest trip per direction), compared against APTA / TransitWiki benchmarks (too-close < 600 ft, target ~750–1,320 ft, hard max 2,640 ft).
- ✅ **Stop balancing candidates** — consecutive same-route pairs closer than a threshold (default 600 ft), flagged for consolidation with an order-of-magnitude daily time saving (dwell seconds × trips/day). Terminals and stations are excluded; the lower-service stop is the removal candidate.
- ✅ **Service intensity per stop** — trips/day, span of service, and peak vs. off-peak median headway on the busiest weekday (or a chosen service day). Also surfaced on the per-stop Trips tab.
- ✅ **Accessibility completeness** — share of board points with `wheelchair_boarding` populated, plus a per-route breakdown of the gaps; cross-links to the validator warning (§1.8).
- ✅ Contextual map highlighting (`StopAnalysisLayer`): amber removal candidates, a trips/day colour ramp, and accessibility-gap pins.
- 🚫 Stop-level ridership estimates — deliberately not synthesised; honest answer requires APC data.

## 3. Account, organization & billing

Architecture, data model, full API surface, and live operational state are in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (§2 data model, §3 API, §5 live state).

The backend tier is implemented as a single Cloudflare Worker that also serves the SPA's static assets and the public feeds origin. D1 holds metadata; R2 holds working-state JSON, snapshots, GTFS zips, org logos, and feed thumbnails; KV holds rate-limit counters.

### 3.1 Authentication

- ✅ Email + password signup with email verification.
- ✅ Magic-link login.
- ✅ Password reset.
- ✅ Logout (per-session) + logout-all-devices.
- ✅ HTTP-only `Secure SameSite=Lax` session cookies; idle (30d) + absolute (90d) timeouts.
- ✅ Cloudflare Turnstile captcha gate on `/auth/signup` (Managed mode; site key public, secret as Worker secret).
- ✅ Rate limits on all `/auth/*` endpoints (KV-backed, per IP + per email).
- ✅ Account settings: change name, email (with re-verify), password, soft-delete account.
- ⚠️ Password hashing is PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 @ 100k iterations (workerd cap). Argon2id migration (**NF-40a**) should land before broad RTAP distribution; details in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §4 / §9. Tracked in GitHub issues.
- 🔲 Google OAuth (deferred to v1.1). Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 3.2 Organizations

- ✅ Create / rename / delete (soft-delete) orgs.
- ✅ Membership roles: `owner`, `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`. Many-to-many — one user can belong to multiple orgs (consultant case is a primary scenario).
- ✅ Invitation flow (email-based; consumer signs up if needed and joins on accept).
- ✅ Ownership transfer; last-owner protection.
- ✅ Org settings page at `/orgs/<slug>` — members, roles, invitations, branding.
- 🔲 Per-project membership granularity (a user scoped to a single project inside an org) is not built. Tracked in GitHub issues (BE-95).

### 3.3 Workspaces and feed ownership

- ✅ A feed project is owned by either a user (personal) or an org. Slug uniqueness is per `(owner_type, owner_id)`.
- ✅ Workspace switcher in the top bar; `My Feeds` page is workspace-scoped.
- ✅ Cross-workspace feed transfer: kebab → "Move to…" with workspace picker (Personal + every org where the user is editor+). Auto-suffixes the slug on collision; updates `publication.canonical_slug` in lockstep so a published feed's URL keeps pointing at the same project after a move.
- ✅ Anonymous → signed-in import: local IndexedDB projects can be uploaded to the server on first sign-in; collision/quota prompts.

### 3.4 Quotas and abuse controls

- ✅ **Plan-based quotas** (`worker/projects/quotas.ts`), enforced as soft-warn at the 90% threshold (`HARD_LIMITS=true` flips to hard rejection — for the eventual RTAP licensing model):

  | Plan | Saved projects | Snapshots / project | Max ZIP | Published feeds |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Free | 3 | 5 | 20 MB | 0 |
  | Pro | 10 | 25 | 50 MB | 1 |
  | Agency | unlimited | 50 | 100 MB | unlimited |
  | Enterprise | unlimited | 200 | 200 MB | unlimited |

- ✅ Per-IP + per-email rate limits on auth endpoints.
- ✅ Turnstile signup gate.
- ✅ CSRF defense via `X-GB-Client` header on state-changing endpoints.
- ✅ Admin can disable / re-enable users (§3.5).
- 🔲 Further abuse controls (freeze new signups by IP, take down a user's publications). Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 3.5 Admin console

- ✅ Routes under `/admin` gated on `user.staff = 1`; non-staff get 404 (not 403) to avoid surface enumeration.
- ✅ Dashboard counters (users by status, orgs, projects, snapshots, publications, signups this week/month, active-user proxy via session activity, subscription tier breakdown).
- ✅ Users: paginated table, filter by status + email substring, row actions (disable / re-enable, resend verification, impersonate).
- ✅ Orgs: paginated table, member-role management.
- ✅ Audit log: filtered + paginated viewer with CSV export.
- ✅ Events: cookieless page-view analytics. Inbound `?ref=` tag captured once per session (stripped from the URL), tallied on `/admin/events` with date presets (7d / 30d / all / custom). No IP, no UA, no user id stored (NF-54 / NF-73; see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §4). The `?gclid=` ad-attribution tag is captured the same way and fed to the Google Ads offline-conversion pipeline.
- 🔲 Global full-text search, bulk operations, abuse review queues — deferred. Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 3.6 Org branding

- ✅ Per-project primary color (hex) — drives the active service-day tab + accent links on every embed surface (CSS custom property `--brand`).
- ✅ Per-org logo upload (PNG / JPEG / WebP / SVG; ≤1 MB) at `/api/orgs/:id/logo`. Public read at `feeds.gtfsx.com/_/orgs/<id>/logo` with edge cache + ETag.
- ✅ Logo renders next to the agency name on the mini-site landing, per-route, per-stop, and system-map embeds.
- 🔲 Custom CSS variables / advanced theming (EM-60). Tracked in GitHub issues.
- 🔲 Per-route display-name override (EM-61). Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 3.7 Billing and subscription plans

Self-serve subscriptions via Stripe — live in production since 2026-05-15
(`worker/billing/*`, `src/components/billing/*`; gated by `BILLING_ENABLED`).

- ✅ Four tiers — **Free / Pro / Agency / Enterprise** (internal plan ids `free` / `pro` / `agency` / `enterprise`; `agency` was `team` before the pricing-v2 rename, migration 0017):
  - **Free** $0 — editor + up to 3 cloud-saved feeds; no publishing.
  - **Pro** $49/mo · $499/yr — Premium Feed Management (hosting, publishing, embeds, mini-site).
  - **Agency** $299/mo · $2,499/yr — adds the full route-planning suite + org workspaces + unlimited feeds + GTFS-Realtime Service Alerts authoring (§4.5); 14-day free trial (card up front).
  - **Enterprise** — custom (talk to sales).
- ✅ Stripe Checkout upgrade flow (`/upgrade`; per-card monthly/annual toggle, defaults to annual).
- ✅ Stripe customer portal for managing / cancelling; 30-day prorated-refund policy.
- ✅ Webhooks (`/api/billing/webhooks/stripe`) sync subscription state → D1 `subscription` + cached `plan`/status on `user` / `organization`.
- ✅ Server-side feature gating via `requireOwnerFeature` (e.g. `managed_publishing`, `draft_links`, `analysis_basic`, `analysis_title_vi`, `org_workspace`, `org_logo`, `brand_color`, `service_alerts`); `PaywallOverlay` is the client surface. `service_alerts` → Agency + Enterprise.
- ✅ Org workspaces are an Agency+ feature — Free/Pro users are routed to `/upgrade` rather than creating empty orgs.
- ✅ Plan catalog served from the worker, with an in-SPA fallback for the public `/pricing` page; done-for-you services (fix / build a feed) advertised there via a scoping-call booking + email (not a billed product).
- Pricing history (the Team→Agency rename + the v2 price change) is preserved in the archived `PRICING_RESTRUCTURE.md`.

---

## 4. Feed publication and distribution

Architecture and API surface are in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (§3 API, §1 module map).

### 4.1 Canonical publication

- ✅ "Publish" promotes a saved snapshot to the canonical URL `feeds.gtfsx.com/<slug>/gtfs.zip`. Stable across republishes; only the bytes change.
- ✅ Validation gate: errors block publish; warnings allowed (configurable per-publish).
- ✅ Cache headers tuned for GTFS ingestors: `public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=3600`, version-id ETag, `Last-Modified`, 304 support, atomic R2 → D1 pointer flip.
- ✅ Sidecar `feeds.*/<slug>/feed_info.json` with title, description, effective dates, version id, contact, distribution targets, registered RT feeds.
- ✅ Unpublish — pointer cleared, canonical URL returns `410 Gone`. Republish restores.
- ✅ Publication history view + rollback ("publish this old snapshot again").
- ✅ Per-snapshot state stored as gzipped JSON (R2) plus a rendered ZIP (also R2); two immutable blobs per snapshot.
- 🔲 Scheduled publish ("go live on 2026-06-01 at 02:00 UTC") — BE-77, stretch. Tracked in GitHub issues.

### 4.2 Draft links

- ✅ "Get review link" generates `feeds.*/<slug>/draft/<token>.zip` with an unguessable 192-bit token (hashed at rest). 30-day default expiry, renewable, revocable.
- ✅ `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`; feeds-origin `robots.txt` disallows `/draft/`.
- ✅ Each draft URL points to a specific `feed_snapshot` so the bytes don't change once a link is shared.

### 4.3 Catalog submissions and distribution metadata

- ✅ One-time opt-in per project at first publish: register with the Mobility Database (real API call against the existing refresh token).
- 🟡 transit.land submission — wired through the same `CatalogClient` interface but stubbed (status=`pending`, manual-review marker). Pre-RTAP follow-up. Tracked in GitHub issues.
- ✅ Externally-hosted GTFS-RT feed URLs can be registered per project (vehicle_positions / trip_updates / alerts). These are metadata only — we forward them in `feed_info.json` but don't proxy them. (Distinct from the alerts feed we *generate* in §4.5.)
- ✅ ID-stability check on publish: warns when a publish would drop or rename a `trip_id` / `stop_id` / `route_id` / `agency_id` referenced by a registered *external* RT feed. (Our own managed Service Alerts feed self-renders and is excluded.)
- ✅ Distribution checklist UI: Mobility DB (auto), transit.land (auto/stub), Google Transit Partners + Apple Maps Transit + Transit app (external links + manual mark-done).
- ✅ **GTFS-Realtime Service Alerts generation is in scope** (§4.5). Trip Updates and Vehicle Positions remain out of scope — they require live AVL ingestion.

### 4.4 Embeddable maps and schedules

Live in production.

Architecture: server-rendered HTML on the FEEDS origin (Hono `html` template), edge-cached, version-id ETag. Same renderer powers the public mini-site landing, the iframe embeds, and shared social-card meta. Mapbox GL JS via CDN; the SPA's existing public publishable token is also bound to the Worker as `MAPBOX_TOKEN`.

| Surface | URL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Mini-site landing | `feeds.*/<slug>/` | ✅ — agency name + contact, system map, route list, today's-service banner, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, indexable |
| Per-route embed | `feeds.*/<slug>/embed/route/<route_id>` | ✅ — route map + schedule table with seasonal/day-pattern tabs, defaults to today's pattern |
| Per-stop embed | `feeds.*/<slug>/embed/stop/<stop_id>` | ✅ — chronological "departures today" + map + routes serving the stop |
| System-map embed | `feeds.*/<slug>/embed/system-map` | ✅ — all routes coloured, clickable stop dots, route list |
| Demo agency page | `/embed-demo/` (editor origin) | ✅ — fake "Sunny Valley Transit" page demonstrating iframe usage |

Cross-cutting embed features:

- ✅ Today's-service banner ("Today is Friday · Weekday schedule in effect" / "No service today") computed in agency timezone.
- ✅ Feed-expiry warning when within 14 days of `feed_end_date` (yellow) or already past (red).
- ✅ Service-day tabs split by both day pattern AND date range — feeds with seasonal services (e.g., summer / fall / spring weekday variants) get separate tabs disambiguated by date.
- ✅ Per-org brand logo + per-project brand color applied via CSS custom properties.
- ✅ Open Graph + Twitter card meta on every embed page.
- ✅ Auto-generated route-map thumbnail (whole-system map, routes in `route_color`) via the Mapbox Static Images API, cached in R2 (migration 0016); used as the `og:image` on the mini-site and as the card image in the feeds list. A styled fallback (gray bus outline + GTFS·X wordmark) renders before the thumbnail exists.
- ✅ Mobile responsive layout (220px map on phones, sticky stop-name column, narrower tabs).
- ✅ Editor "Embed" bottom-tab on a published feed: copy-pasteable iframe snippets per route + system map; live brand-color picker.
- 🔲 `widgets.js` declarative web-component loader (`<gtfs-route-map>`, `<gtfs-schedule>`).
- 🔲 Headless JSON API at `feeds.*/<slug>/api/*`.
- 🔲 Localization — UI strings in English only; Spanish queued (Streamline already publishes Spanish PDFs, so demand exists). Per-route display-name overrides + `translations.txt` consumption deferred to the same phase.
- 🔲 Per-stop / per-route impression counters (`embed_view_count`) and the agency-facing usage view.
- 🔲 GTFS-RT integration on stop pages (live arrival times when an RT feed is registered) — stretch.

(The Phase 7 embed backlog above is tracked in GitHub issues.)
- 🚫 Custom domains for published feeds. Agencies can `301` from their own domain if needed; we don't issue per-tenant certs.

### 4.5 GTFS-Realtime Service Alerts (Agency+)

Authoring of GTFS-Realtime **Service Alerts** in a new "Service Alerts" workspace section, served as a spec-compliant `FeedMessage`. Engineering detail in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (BE-90..93).

- ✅ Alerts are **project-scoped** and **decoupled from publish** — posting or expiring an alert takes effect on the live feed without republishing the schedule. Each alert is a `service_alert` D1 row (migration `0018`), not an R2 blob; the protobuf is rendered on demand.
- ✅ CRUD + activate/deactivate + live preview under `/api/projects/:id/alerts`, gated by project `editor` access **and** the `service_alerts` feature (Agency+). Cause / Effect / Severity, multiple active windows, and affected-entity pickers (routes / stops / whole agency, optional direction) populated from the live editor.
- ✅ Served **public** at `feeds.gtfsx.com/<slug>/alerts.pb` (`application/x-protobuf`) and `/alerts.json`, `FeedMessage` v2.0 / FULL_DATASET, only currently-active alerts (status + `active_period`), `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30`. Authoring is gated; the served feeds are open (consumers are trip planners).
- ✅ Validation: ≥1 informed entity, non-empty header, `end > start` on windows; **warns** (doesn't block) when a referenced `route_id`/`stop_id` isn't in the published feed.
- ✅ **RT coexistence (Option A):** authoring auto-wires a managed `project_rt_feed` row (`kind='alerts'`, `managed=1`) pointing at our `alerts.pb` so `feed_info.json` advertises it; never two alerts feeds (if an external one exists the UI forces a choice); the row is removed when all alerts are deleted.
- ✅ Single language for v1 (`TranslatedString` with one translation). 🔲 Multi-language alert text — backlog (BE-93).
- 🚫 Trip Updates / Vehicle Positions / push notifications / auto-generated alerts — out of scope.

## 5. Community forum

A public Q&A / discussion forum at `/community`, server-rendered for SEO. Shipped
(`worker/forum/*`, `src/components/community/*`; migrations 0008 / 0010 / 0011).

- ✅ Categories (announcements, getting-started, editor, import-export, embeds-publishing, feature-requests, bugs, general), threads, and markdown posts.
- ✅ Post upvotes (one per user, toggleable); "mark solved" on a thread's answer.
- ✅ Thread subscriptions (auto on create/reply, manual toggle) with Resend email notifications; admin alert on new threads.
- ✅ Per-user forum profile — forum display name independent of the account name, gravatar opt-out, email preferences, ban support.
- ✅ Image attachments uploaded to R2 (`gtfs-builder-forum-images`); markdown rendering.
- ✅ FTS5 full-text search (`forum_search`).
- ✅ Server-side rendering with Open Graph + canonical URLs + sitemap (indexable).
- ✅ Moderation (staff): edit / soft-delete / lock / pin / move / ban.

## Cross-cutting

### Mapping platform — Mapbox GL JS

The original platform analysis is preserved here because the choice still drives most map-related decisions:

| Consideration | Mapbox GL JS | Google Maps JS API | Leaflet + OSM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drawing/editing tools | Excellent — `mapbox-gl-draw` supports points, lines, polygons with snapping, vertex editing, drag | Drawing library exists but limited vertex editing, no snapping | `leaflet-draw` works but less polished |
| Custom map styling | Full control — Studio editor, custom tilesets | Limited via JSON; fewer options | Tile-provider dependent |
| Performance (large shapes) | WebGL-rendered, handles thousands of shape points | Good but heavier DOM usage | Canvas mode helps but slower |
| Polygon support (Flex zones) | Native, with editing handles | Basic | Basic |
| Pricing | 50K free map loads/mo, then $0.60/1K | $7/1K loads after $200 credit | Free, tile-quality / hosting tradeoffs |
| Developer experience | Excellent docs, TypeScript, `react-map-gl` | Mature but more boilerplate | Very flexible but more DIY |

We use `react-map-gl` + `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw` in the editor and Mapbox GL JS via CDN in the embed renderer. The Map Matching API powers snap-to-road; the Static Images API renders feed thumbnails. Cost stays well under the free tier at current usage.

### Infrastructure

Single Cloudflare account; everything runs as a single Worker with static-asset binding and multiple custom domains.

```
www.gtfsx.com          → editor SPA + /api + /auth + /_demand-tiles
gtfsx.com (apex)       → same as www
feeds.gtfsx.com        → public feed distribution + embed renderer
                               + /_/orgs/<id>/logo public read

staging.gtfsx.com      → staging editor
staging-feeds.gtfsx.com → staging feeds origin
```

| Concern | Service |
|---|---|
| Compute | Cloudflare Worker (single `gtfs-builder` deploy + `gtfs-builder-staging`) |
| Relational metadata (users, orgs, projects, snapshots, publications, subscriptions, forum, audit, events) | D1 |
| Rate-limit counters, KV cache | KV |
| Tiles + feed blobs | R2 (`gtfs-builder-tiles` for PMTiles; `gtfs-builder-feeds` / `gtfs-builder-feeds-staging` for working states, snapshots, ZIPs, org logos, feed thumbnails; `gtfs-builder-forum-images` for forum attachments) |
| Transactional email | Resend |
| Bot mitigation | Cloudflare Turnstile (signup) |
| Web analytics | Cloudflare Web Analytics (cookieless, zone-level) |

Frontend stack: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Zustand (Immer middleware) for state, Radix UI + Tailwind, Dexie for IndexedDB, JSZip + PapaParse for GTFS, `@turf/turf` for geometry, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` for the worker test harness.

### Design direction

- **Mood**: warm, approachable, slightly playful — a planning tool, not enterprise GIS.
- **Palette**: warm neutrals (cream, sand, soft brown) with vibrant accent colours for routes; coral primary; teal save indicator.
- **Typography**: rounded sans-serif headings, clean body text.
- **Map style**: Mapbox `light-v11` baseline, route shapes coloured per `route_color`, stop dots as white-with-dark-border.
- **Empty states**: illustrated and encouraging.
- **Editor layout** (since 2026-05): **two-rail shell** — a responsive **left rail** for navigation between sections (continuously resizable 40–260 px via a drag handle; renders 3 variants by width: icon-only / icons + labels / full rows + accordion section caps; responsive default per viewport), centre map, **right rail** at 460 px hosting all configuration panels (opens on section selection, collapses to a thin reopen strip during shape-edit, `Cmd/Ctrl + /` toggle), and a collapsible bottom panel (timetable, validation, snapshots, publish, embed, activity). Route detail is master-detail with a breadcrumb, swatch + title row, Duplicate / Delete header actions, and Details / Stops / Trips / Shapes / Costs tabs that focus the map appropriately. Three-tier text hierarchy across all panels — section H2 (rail header) / sub-section H3 (`<RailSubHeading>`) / uppercase form-field eyebrow.
- **Topbar**: shared `<AppBrand>` + `<UserMenu>` across every page (editor, feeds, account, orgs, admin). The right-edge avatar slot is consistent across signed-out (outlined person icon) and signed-in (coral initials avatar) states, divided from the editor actions. Tagline hides below 1100 px viewport, save-status text below 900 px. Help moved to a floating "? HELP" pill at the bottom-left of the map area.

### Non-functional requirements

- **Performance**: 60 fps map interaction; feeds with 500+ stops, 50+ routes; import/export of 10 MB feeds within 10 s; autosave (local) within 1 s.
- **Usability**: no GTFS expertise required; warm visual design; desktop-primary, tablet-friendly; keyboard shortcuts for common map operations.
- **Data integrity**: referential integrity enforced (e.g., orphaned reference auto-fix surfaced in the export dialog); IDs auto-generated and overridable; IndexedDB persistence keeps anonymous editor work safe across crashes; explicit Save button for server-backed feeds with `beforeunload` guard on unsaved changes.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA target for non-map UI; embed pages audited with axe-core; schedule tables use `<th scope="row">` / `<th scope="col">` for screen-reader compatibility.
- **Privacy**: PII limited to email, display name, IP + UA on active sessions, and feed contents; no third-party analytics; no marketing tracking.
- **Auditability**: every state-changing backend action writes an `audit_event` (login, publish, delete, member changes, admin impersonation, transfers, …).

### User workflow

The editor guides users through this default path, though every section is reachable at any time via the left nav rail:

```
1. Agency setup           →  Who operates this transit?
2. Calendars + holidays   →  When does service run?
3. Routes & shapes        →  What paths do vehicles take? (alignments first)
4. Stops                  →  Pick a route, place stops along it (snap-to-route default)
5. Fares                  →  How much does it cost to ride? (prompted if missing)
6. Timetables             →  What are the trip times?
7. Flex zones (optional)  →  Demand-responsive areas + booking rules
8. Analysis               →  Demand dots, coverage, Title VI, stop analysis, cost
9. Validate & publish     →  Errors → fix; warnings → optional. Publish to a stable URL.
10. Embed                 →  Copy iframe snippets into the agency website.
```

On first load: nothing is selected, the right rail is closed, and the map fills the available width. Clicking any left-nav tile opens the matching configuration panel in the right rail. The bottom panel surfaces analytical views (timetable, validation, etc.) and is collapsible — it ducks under the left rail only and spans the full width across map + right rail.

## Companion documents

This file is the product-feature map. Engineering depth lives in one place:

| Doc | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | The single engineering reference — system architecture, data model, full API surface, security / privacy NFRs (preserves the `BE-*` / `NF-*` anchors), live environment state, git + deploy workflow, provisioning + operator runbooks, and the demand-dot regen + Google Ads OCI appendices. |
| [`brand-kit/`](./brand-kit/) | Brand assets — logos, palette, fonts, guidelines. |
| GitHub issues | The backlog of 🔲 planned features (Fares-v2 authoring UI, ferry support, `frequencies`/`pathways`, scheduled publish, embed Phase 7, argon2id, large-feed perf, etc.). |

Superseded specs and historical records — the original backend / embeds / forum /
freemium specs, the pricing-restructure and domain-migration logs, the demand-dot
build plan, and the marketing plans — are preserved under `docs/archive/`
(gitignored; local reference only).
